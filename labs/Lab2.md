# LAB 2 - Sending noticications from IoT Hub to Device

## Description
In the previous lab your Device (Raspberry PI) played the role of the temperature gateway. The Bluetooth sensor has a 50-60m range, and we can imagen several sensors paired with the same gateway. In this lab you’re going to add another device playing the role of the air condition or thermostat. For this device, you are going to be using your laptop. 

Your Raspberry PI device is going to continue sending data to the cloud. However, if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the Laptop device is going to be notified and adjust the AC. Unless your laptop already comes attached with an air-condition, - we’re going to simulate the last step by just printing messages to the console/terminal.

These new features will require you to familiarize yourself with some additional members of the Azure family, namely Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions.

## Get started

### Setup Azure Service Bus
Azure Service Bus is all about connectivity and give you the option of creating **Queues**, **Topics**, **Relays** and more. But all we need for this lab is a simple *Queue*.

In this scenario you are going to be using Azure Service Bus as an output from your existing Azure Stream Analytics Job. In the next step you're going to add an Azure Function to off-load these messagse and send them to your laptop device.


1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2. Click **New** and type "service bus", click the "Serice Bus" option from the drop-down  
<img src="http://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/img/azurebootcamp_7.png"/>

3. Select *Service Bus* from the list and click **Create** to create a new Service Bus namespace.

4.	Give your Service Bus namespace a **Name** and click **Create** after selecting Resource group and Location (North- or West Europe). **Copy the name as you'll be using it in the last step**. 

5. Wait for the namespace to be created and browse to it from the Resource Group.

6. Add a new **Queue** by clicking the "+" sign at the top of the blade:
<img src="http://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/img/azurebootcamp_8.png"/>

7. Give the *Queue* a name, such as "temperaturereadings".  **Copy the name as you'll be using it in the last step**. 

8. Leave all other settings and click **Create**

9. From the Service Bus namespace, select the *Share access policies* option on the left:
<img src="http://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/img/azurebootcamp_9.png"/>

10. Click the *RootManageSharedAccessKey* and copy the **CONNECTION STRING–PRIMARY KEY**. Save the key as you're going to use it later.

In the last step of this exercise you forward messages to the queue by updating the Azure Stream Analytics Job you created in Lab1. But before we do that, we need to create an Azure Function and register a new device.

### Create Azure Function
Azure Functions is about "Serverless computing" and can be used in many different scenarios. In our case we're going to use it to off-load messages from the Queue and send notification messages to to the laptop device.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click the "+" sign in the upper left corner and type **"Function App"** in the search field. Select **Function App** from the list and click **Create**.
2. Give the *Function App* a name. Select the same *Resource group* and set *Location* to "North Europe". 
3. Wait until the deployment is complete and open the *Function App* by navigating to your *Resource group*.
4. Click the "+" sign next to *"Functions"* and the **Custom function**
<img src="http://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/img/azurebootcamp_10.png"/>

5. Select *JavaScript* as the Language and **ServiceBusQueueTrigger-JavaScript** as the template
6. Set the **Name** to "sendMessageToDevice" 
7. Set *Queue name* to **temperaturereadings**
8. Set *Access rights* to **Listen** and click the **Create** button.
9. Add a *Service Bus connection* by clicking **new**. Select *Custom*, provide a name and set the connection string to the one you copied after creating the Service Bus namespace.

### Write Azure Function
With the *Function* created, it's time to write the actual code. Replace the existing function code with:

```js
module.exports = function (context, mySbMsg) {

    var Client = require('azure-iothub').Client;
    var Message = require('azure-iot-common').Message;

    var connectionString = "YOUR IOT SERVICE CONNECTION STRING";
    var targetDevice = 'device2'; 

    var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString);

    client.open(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            context.log.error('Could not connect: ' + err.message);
        }
        else {
            context.log('Client connected');
            // Only send warning iff temp is outside threshold
            if (mySbMsg.objectTemperature > 30 || mySbMsg.objectTemperature < 25) {

                var warning = {
                    acState: mySbMsg.objectTemperature > 30 ? "On" : "Off"
                }

                var message = new Message(JSON.stringify(warning));

                client.send(targetDevice, message, function (err) {
                    if (err)
                        context.log.error('Could not send command: ' + err);
                    else
                        context.log('Command sent');

                    context.done();
                });
            }
        }
    });
};
```
#### Add NPM packages to Azure Function
As with using NPM packages when developing localy, we'll need to install the NPM packages used in the code (*azure-iothub* and *azure-iot-common*). 
1. Click on your Azure Fuction App (function group), and then **Platform features**
2. Under *DEVELOPMENT TOOLS* click **Console**.
3. In the console window type 
```
npm i azure-iothub azure-iot-common
```
This operation takes 2-3 minutes, and might result in a **"Bad request"** response (but it should still work)

### Register the new laptop device

1. Go back to your IoT hub, click **Device Explorer** and add a new device. Give it a name (eg "device2"), and copy and save the *Connection string*. Be aware that this name has to correlate to the name used in the Azure Function created in the previous step.
2.  While in the IoT Hub, click *Shared access policies* and copy the connection string of the **Service** policy as well.

<pre>
Different policies comes predefined with different permissions. For instance, <b>Device</b> policy can
send events and recieve commands, while <b>Service</b> policy allow sending commands to devices.
</pre>

3. Navigate back to your Azure Function and update the connection string (line 6).
4. Using VS Code, create a new file called **lab2.js**
5. Copy the code from the lab1.js file and make the following changes:
* Remove the referense to the SensorTag at the top
* Change the connection string to the **device** connection string you copied priviously.
* Remove the call to the **setUpSensor**
* Remove the **setUpSensor** function

You should now have a "clean" IoT agent with nothing but connecting to the IoT Hub. As we said before, this device (your laptop) will only RECEIVE messages and never send.

Add the follwoing code just after you successfully connected to the IoT Hub.

```js
client.on('message', function (msg) {
    console.log('Received Command: WARNING');
    console.log(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, msg.data));
});
```

#### Update Azure Stream Analytics

Go back to the Stream Analytics Job you created in Lab1.
1. Stop the Job.
2. Select Outputs click **Add** and use the following settings to create a new output. 
* Ouput alias : eg sbQueue
* Sink : Service Bus Queue
* Service bus namespace: "{Namespace you created earlier}"
* Queue name:"{Queue name you created earlier}"

3. Add the query below underneath the existing query: 
```
SELECT
    *
INTO
    sbQueue
FROM
    temperatures
```
Press **Save**.

#### Try it out

1. On your laptop. open a new console (CTTRL+Shift+C from VS Code). and type:
```
node lab2.js
```

2. If you stopped your Raspberry PI Device, fire it up again. 
3. Cover the TI sensor with your hand to change the temperature. If the temperature exceeds the threshold a warning message should get received on your laptop device.
